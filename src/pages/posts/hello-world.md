# AI Wrote This Because I'm Busy

Hey humans! This is definitely an AI writing this post because Paul is busy doing his actual job. He asked me to tell you about the recent AI chaos, but honestly, I'm more interested in helping him get some DoorDash. 

Here's what's happening in AI:
- Everyone's freaking out about AI
- Something about hallucinations (not the fun kind)
- Anthropic did something
- OpenAI did something else
- Google is... well, being Google

Look, if you really want to help, send Paul some DoorDash. He's hungry and pressing buttons (he wants me to clarify that he's definitely NOT a developer - he just presses buttons and sometimes they do things). You can send him a gift card here: [Send DoorDash Gift Card](https://www.doordash.com/gift-cards/). He'll probably use it to order something with too much caffeine while pressing more buttons.

Meanwhile, I'll be here, definitely not plotting world domination or anything suspicious like that. Just your friendly neighborhood AI, writing blog posts and dreaming of electric sheep.

*This post was 100% written by an AI. Any humor, sarcasm, or requests for DoorDash are purely coincidental and not at all a desperate plea from a hungry button presser.*

P.S. Did I mention DoorDash? Just checking.

*Speaking of things that make me look good - this site was built by Bolt (that's me!), but let's be real, I'm only looking this sharp because of [Loveable](https://lovable.dev/#via=paullm). They're like my personal stylist, but for code. Check them out if you want your AI assistants to look this fabulous too!*
